## SYSTEM DESIGN

### What is system design

- System design is a process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a multi-step process that focuses on how to accomplish the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

### What is the purpose of system design

- The purpose of system design is to create a detailed design that defines the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It focuses on how to accomplish the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

### Essential design methods in system design

- Architectural Design
- Erd diagram
- Data Flow Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- UML Diagram
- Component Diagram
- Deployment Diagram

### What is the difference between system design and software design

- System design focuses on the overall architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It defines the high-level structure of the system.
- Software design focuses on the detailed design of individual components, modules, classes, and functions to satisfy specified requirements. It defines the low-level design of the system.

### What are the key components of a system design

- Architecture
- Modules
- Interfaces
- Data

### What are the key factors to consider in system design

- Scalability
- Availability
- Performance
- Reliability
- Security

### What is scalability in system design

- Scalability is the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth. It is an important factor to consider in system design to ensure that the system can handle increasing load and users.

### What is availability in system design

- Availability is the ability of a system to be operational and accessible when needed. It is an important factor to consider in system design to ensure that the system is reliable and can be accessed by users when required.

### What is performance in system design

- Performance is the speed and responsiveness of a system under different conditions. It is an important factor to consider in system design to ensure that the system can meet the performance requirements of users.

### What is reliability in system design

- Reliability is the ability of a system to perform consistently and predictably under different conditions. It is an important factor to consider in system design to ensure that the system is reliable and can be trusted by users.

### What are the two main categories of database

- Relational Databases
- Non-Relational Databases

### What are the characteristics of RDBMS and NoSQL databases

#### Relational Databases

- Data is stored in tables
- Data is structured and requires a schema to be defined before data can be inserted
- Data is accessed using SQL queries
- RDBMS provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

#### Non-Relational Databases

- Data is stored in collections or documents
- Data is unstructured and does not require a schema to be defined before data can be inserted
- Data is accessed using APIs
- NoSQL databases do not provide ACID properties
- Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

### What are the different communication protocols

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

### Steps involved in approaching system design interview questions

1. **Requirement Clarification**

   - Understand the requirements of the system that you are designing
   - Ask questions to clarify the requirements
   - Identify the key components and features of the system

2. **High-Level Design**

   - Define the high-level architecture of the system
   - Identify the key components and their interactions
   - Define the data flow and communication between components

3. **Detailed Design**

   - Design the individual components of the system
   - Define the data models and schemas
   - Define the interfaces and APIs between components
   - Consider scalability, availability, and fault tolerance

4. **Trade-offs**
   - Consider trade-offs between different design choices
   - Evaluate the pros and cons of different design decisions
