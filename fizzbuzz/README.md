## FizzBuzz

### Problem Description

Write a program that outputs the numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers that are multiples of 3, print "number - Fizz". For numbers that are multiples of 5, print "number - Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "number - FizzBuzz". If a number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, simply print the number itself.

### Example

```
1
2
3-Fizz
4
